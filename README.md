# White-Blood-Cells-Image-Classification
Classification done  using CNN
White Blood Cells (leukocytes), play an important role in the immune system by defending the body against infectious diseases and foreign invaders. A healthy adult's WBC's count ranges between 4,000 and 11,000 WBCs per cubic millimeter of blood depending on the gender, age and level of activity among other factors.
### Types of White blood cells
1. Granulocytes
2. Monocytes
3. Lymphocytes
4. Neutrophils
5. Basophils
# Problem Statement
Manual  identification, analysis and classification of white blood cells from microscopic images proves difficult process due to the following reasons:
> - Subject to bias
> - innacurate classification due to human errors
> - Variations in the maturition stage
> - Intra class variations of cell shapes due to different acquisition and staining processes
> - Poor sensitivity
# Solution

By the use of a convolutional neural network, we aim to correctly classify the white blood cells into their respective categories
# Experimental Research Design
The following are the assumptions that must be satisfied in order to use the true experiment research design :

Control group and experimental group
Researcher - manipulated variable(s)
Random distribution
